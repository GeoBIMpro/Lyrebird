## Description ##
Explorations for a presumptive version 2 of Lyrebird. The project has been on the backburner for a while, and there are plenty of services and projects popping up over the years since Lyrebird started that may be able to do what this is trying to do with at least more flexibility. I don't really know what a finished version of V2 will look like, or when I'd have time to finish it, but as a start I've started exploring a better communication pipeline between the two applications. At this stage Lyrebird V2 does absolutely nothing of consequence, but it's a start.

Plugins for Audoesk Revit and McNeel's Rhino plugin Grasshopper that allow information to be exchanged primarily from Grasshopper to Revit.  Allows for native Revit elements to be instantiated in a Revit project from data created in Grasshopper.
